# Leevee 
This is a todo list app based on *Ivy Lee* method, written in *Clojure*.

## Background
Actually this is my practice DB project with *Clojure*. As of **30 Dec 2020**, I'm writing *Clojure* for 17 days and this is my second project. My first project is the *WooCommerce* REST API client in *Clojure* ([wc-api-clj](https://github.com/codemascot/wc-api-clj)). Hereby, I wanted to make my second one something DB interaction oriented. But web app seemed too boring to me as I've come from web development background. Also I didn't have much exposure to *CLI* app writing world. So, I took this chance to make a CLI app with DB interaction. Yes, I'm aware of the cost of fire up JVM whenever this app is initiating, still I've grabbed the chance to play with *Clojure* as well as *CLI*.

## Setup

1. Rename `env.example` to `.env` and put your DB credentials there.

2. Run the migration. Also for MySQL you can import `db/leevee.sql` to create the DB.

3. Run the program with `lein run`.
Example: 
```
lein run add --day "2020-12-29"
lein run edit --day "2020-12-29" --order 2 --status "DONE"
```.
